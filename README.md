** Command-line Rock, Paper and Scissors game

This gem allows you to play command-line Rock, Paper and Scissors game. You have to just give one option from rock, paper and scissor. It will display either you or computer won. There might be a case in which user doesn't provide any argument or provide an invalid option, so we have to handle such cases.

You can look for manual using play-rps -e

Example play-rps rock . It will give you the following output:

       `Computer played scissors`

       `You Won!`
